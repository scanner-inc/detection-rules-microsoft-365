name: A Microsoft Teams member was made owner of multiple teams
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user becomes the owner of multiple Microsoft Teams, which may indicate a privilege escalation threat.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Microsoft Teams audit logs for events where the event name is `MemberRoleChanged` and the role value is `2`, indicating a change to Owner role. Typically, users own a few teams related to specific topics. If this change occurs for an external user or someone whose role does not align with the assigned teams, it may signal malicious activity.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the user intended to make the assigned user the owner of the teams.
  2. If the user did not intend to grant owner privileges:
      * Investigate other activities performed by the user.
      * Investigate activities from the source IP.
      * Examine actions taken by the subject user after being granted owner privileges.
      * Initiate your organization's incident response process.
