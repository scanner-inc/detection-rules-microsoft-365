name: Microsoft 365 eDiscovery search export downloaded
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user downloads the results of a content search to their local computer.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Microsoft 365 audit logs for the operation `SearchExportDownloaded`. The Content Search eDiscovery feature allows users to search for email, documents, and instant messaging conversations in tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Inspect the query field to determine if the search criteria warrants further investigation.
  2. Check if there is a legitimate use case for exporting the content search results by contacting the user by email.
  3. If the user is not aware of the download:
     * Investigate other activities performed by the user.
     * Initiate your organization's incident response process and investigate.
