name: Exchange Online mail forwarding rule enabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user sets up a mail forwarding rule to an external email address, which may indicate a security risk.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Microsoft 365 audit logs for events that indicate a mailbox forwarding rule has been set, specifically looking for a set forwarding email address and a successful outcome.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Inspect the forwarding email address to see if it directs emails to an external, non-company owned domain.
  2. Determine if there is a legitimate reason for the mail forwarding rule.
  3. If the user is unaware of the mail forwarding rule, investigate all their accounts for unusual activity.
