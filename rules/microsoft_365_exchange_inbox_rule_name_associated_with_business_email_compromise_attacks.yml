name: Microsoft 365 Exchange inbox rule name associated with business email compromise
  attacks
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user configures an inbox rule with a name commonly linked to business email compromises.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Microsoft 365 Exchange audit logs for the operations New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule. Attackers may establish email rules to conceal incoming emails in a compromised mailbox, using simple names like `.` or `...` for their malicious rules, which are rare in most settings.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Inspect the inbox rule for any indicators:
      * Suspicious keywords in the filter.
      * The rule name.
  2. Confirm the legitimacy of the inbox rule by contacting the user.
  3. If the user is unaware of the inbox rule:
      * Investigate other activities conducted by the user.
      * Initiate the incident response process and investigate further.
