name: A potentially malicious file was sent in a Microsoft Teams message
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a potentially malicious file is sent in Microsoft Teams. Threat actors may send harmful files to unsuspecting users for initial access.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Microsoft 365 SharePoint audit logs for the `FileUploaded` operation. File uploads in Teams use Microsoft Office APIs, and are logged in SharePoint. Differentiate Teams uploads by checking the app name for `Microsoft Teams Chat Files`. This detection looks for file uploads with these extensions:
  - exe
  - msi
  - bin
  - dll
  - bat
  - ps1
  - vbs
  - js
  - scr
  - zip
  - rar
  - 7z
  - cab
  - tar
  - gz
  - bz2

  ## Triage and response
  1. Investigate the potentially malicious file that was sent by viewing the SharePoint link containing the file.
  2. Determine if the user intended to send the observed file.
  3. If the user did not intend to send the file or is a guest/external user:
      * Investigate other activities performed by the user.
      * Initiate your organization's incident response process and conduct further investigation.
